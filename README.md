This is a to-do list that I created during my freshman reading week. It was coded in vanilla HTML, JavaScript, CSS. It is capable of deleting todos and adding todos, as well as saving the list using localStorage.

**What I'd do different**

- Create a database to better manage user's todos
- Incorporate a "checked!" todo - when clicking on todo, it will mark them as checked so the user can track their progress.
